|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**            | Lights are calculated every frame at runtime, affecting static and dynamic objects.                           | Combines real-time and baked lighting; static objects receive baked indirect lighting, while dynamic objects receive real-time direct lighting.                       | Lighting is precomputed and baked into lightmaps; affects only static objects; no dynamic lighting at runtime.                              |
| **Performance**            | Highest performance cost; can impact frame rate on lower-end hardware.                                        | Moderate performance cost; baking reduces runtime overhead but requires some real-time calculations.                                                                  | Lowest performance cost; lighting is fully precomputed, leading to minimal runtime impact.                                                  |
| **Shadows**                | Real-time shadows for static and dynamic objects; shadow quality depends on settings and hardware.             | Static objects cast baked shadows; dynamic objects cast real-time shadows; uses Shadowmask or Distance Shadowmask modes for better blending.                          | Baked shadows for static objects; no real-time shadows from baked lights; dynamic objects require additional real-time lights for shadows.   |
| **Lightmapping**           | Not used; no lightmaps are generated.                                                                         | Generates lightmaps for static indirect lighting; direct lighting can be real-time or baked depending on settings.                                                   | Fully utilizes lightmaps for all lighting on static objects; requires UV mapping and proper baking settings.                                |
| **Light Types Supported**  | Directional, Point, Spot (real-time); Area lights not supported in real-time in URP.                          | Mixed-mode lights supported (Directional, Point, Spot); Area lights baked only.                                                                                      | Supports baked lights including Area lights; all lighting information baked into lightmaps.                                                |
| **Dynamic Objects Support**| Fully supports dynamic objects; real-time lighting and shadows.                                               | Dynamic objects receive real-time direct lighting and shadows; receive baked indirect lighting via Light Probes.                                                      | Dynamic objects are not affected by baked lighting; require real-time lights; Light Probes provide indirect lighting.                       |
| **Global Illumination (GI)**| Limited real-time GI; uses SSGI or other methods; not highly performant.                                      | Baked indirect GI for static objects; dynamic objects receive baked indirect lighting via Light Probes.                                                              | Baked GI for static objects; dynamic objects receive indirect lighting via Light Probes; highest quality GI for static scenes.              |
| **Light Probes**           | Optional; improves lighting for dynamic objects; captures lighting from static environment.                   | Essential for baked indirect lighting on dynamic objects; interpolates lighting across the scene.                                                                     | Essential for dynamic objects to match static environment lighting; without them, dynamic objects lack indirect lighting.                   |
| **Setup Complexity**       | Easy setup; no baking required; may need optimization (e.g., culling, LODs).                                  | Moderate complexity; requires lightmap baking, Light Probe setup, and configuration of Shadowmask modes.                                                              | Complex setup; requires UV unwrapping, lightmap setup, and baking; iteration times are longer due to the baking process.                    |
| **Use Cases**              | Fully dynamic scenes, day-night cycles, or when dynamic effects are essential; useful in prototyping.          | Scenes with static and dynamic objects where performance and lighting quality need balancing; common in many games.                                                   | Static scenes needing maximum performance and no runtime lighting changes; ideal for mobile games or VR.                                    |
| **Pros**                   | - No baking time.<br>- Immediate feedback during development.<br>- Supports dynamic lighting and shadows.<br>- Flexible and adaptable.| - Combines real-time and baked benefits.<br>- Balanced performance and quality.<br>- Dynamic and static lighting effects.<br>- Better indirect lighting than real-time alone.| - High-quality lighting and shadows for static objects.<br>- Excellent indirect lighting and GI.<br>- Minimal runtime overhead.<br>- High performance. |
| **Cons**                   | - High performance cost.<br>- Limited indirect lighting realism.<br>- Hardware-dependent.<br>- Requires aggressive optimization.        | - Baking process is time-consuming.<br>- More complex setup.<br>- May cause artifacts if not configured properly.<br>- Shadows/lighting inconsistencies if misconfigured.| - No dynamic effects.<br>- Static-only setup.<br>- Baking is time-intensive.<br>- Large lightmaps increase build size.<br>- Slow iterations due to re-baking. |
